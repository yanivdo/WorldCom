I created 2 tables:
1) Zipcode table that contain the country code, country name and zip code.
I relayed on that the zip code is not unique between countries.
The countries from the select box are the country list that is from zipcode table.
* I am using the id from the zipcode table for places table to connect them
* I am using MVC pattern to separate the different parts of the code and make it more efficient.
